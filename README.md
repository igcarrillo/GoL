# GoL contains Python code developing a simple version of the cellular automaton Game of Life, with a stochastic initial state and stochastic and pseudostochastic rules
# The objective is characterizing the life expectancy of the automaton in dynamic states while using pseudostochastic rules vs using stochastic rules, and ideally obtain a 
# pseudostochastic rule that generates results which are indistinguishable from stochastic rules, while staying deterministic
# Code is derived from mwharrisjrÂ´s Game-of-Life
